Welcome to my blog, thanks for passing by. I see this as my open diary were I document stuff that I find interesting from my own lived experiences to what I have read or learnt from others. I specifically maintain this blog for my future self to look back on and remind myself of that moment and time. I hope you also find the writing interesting and maybe I hope you learn something from it.
