Welcome to my blog, my name is Nyasha Mawungwe and thanks for passing by. I see this as my open diary, where I document stuff that I find interestingâ€”from my own lived experiences to what I have read or learned from others. I specifically maintain this blog for my future self to look back on and remind myself of that moment in time. I hope you also find the writing interesting, and maybe even learn something from it.
